00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In order to build applications with

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
React you should have at least three months of experience programming JavaScript.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So in this section, I'm going to cover the essential JavaScript features

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that you're going to use a lot in React applications, such as let

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
vs. const keywords, object, the this keyword, and

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
how it behaves differently, arrow functions, object restructuring

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the spread operator classes, and modules.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Make sure you know all these topics well before going further, otherwise

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you're going to have a lot of difficulty later down the road. I just need to clarify

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that in this section I'm not going to go really deep into these concepts because

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
this is a React course, not a JavaScript course, as I told you before,

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I have other JavaScript courses for you, one is called JavaScript basics for

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
beginners and the other is object oriented programming in JavaScript.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The focus of the first course is on the art of problem solving.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It teaches you how to think like a programmer. Unfortunately there are a lot

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
of developers out there in the industry who can build applications with Angular

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
React and all kinds of fancy frameworks, but we can not

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
solve simple programming problems. Because they are self taught programmers,

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
they have never attended a college or university, they never learned

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the fundamentals of computer science and software engineering, and that's why

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I have designed this course. The focus of this second course is on more advanced

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
topics such as constructor functions, objects, prototypes,

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
inheritance, polymorphism, classes and more.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Alright, that's enough introduction, now let's get started!
